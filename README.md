# EMBEDDED SYSTEMS - SHAPE THE WORLD
A two-module embedded systems MOOC based on an ARM Cortex-M4F microcontroller from the University of Texas at Austin through [**edX**].(https://courses.edx.org/)

Date: April - Jully 2017

This 16-week class is split into two 8-week classes : 
- **UT.6.10x Embedded Systems - Shape The World: [Microcontroller Input/Output](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-utaustinx-ut-6-10x)** includes Modules 1 to 10. \
  [**Certificate**](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/6ec84679c9b648f7a051bb0573820f65) available.
- **UT.6.20x Embedded Systems - Shape The World: [Multi-Threaded Interfacing](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-multi-utaustinx-ut-6-20x)** includes Modules 11 to 16. \
  [**Certificate**](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/a6c5861b0e4646a69080f2d2be621aba) available.

You can find a **[syllabus](syllabus.md)** of these 2 courses.


## Common Files

There are some file types which will appear in every lab assignment. \

`***.uvproj` `***.uvgui` `***.uvopt` - uVision files (open `***.uvproj` to get the full project) \
`***.axf` `TExaS.h` `texas.o` - autograder files \
`tm4c123gh6pm.h` - useful address definitions for launchpad \
`startup.s` - assembly startup file

## Requirements

**[Kiel uVsion 4](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/armv4.htm)** - All the code/debug were done on this IDE. \
**[Stellaris/Tiva LaunchPad](http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl)** - Everything is meant to work on a EK-TM4C123G launchpad. \
**[Electronic Components](http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/worldwide.html)** - Some labs requires a set of extra electronic parts.
