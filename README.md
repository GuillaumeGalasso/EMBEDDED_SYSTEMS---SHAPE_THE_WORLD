# EMBEDDED SYSTEMS - SHAPE THE WORLD
A two-module embedded systems MOOC on edX from the University of Texas at Austin. \
Date: June - September 2017

This 16-week class is split into two 8-week classes : 
- **UT.6.10x Embedded Systems - Shape The World: [Microcontroller Input/Output](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-utaustinx-ut-6-10x)** includes Modules 1 to 10. \
  [Certificate]() obtained with a grade of % (*not shown on the certificate but you can find a view [here]()*) \
  [Certifcate Verification]()
- **UT.6.20x Embedded Systems - Shape The World: [Multi-Threaded Interfacing](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-multi-utaustinx-ut-6-20x)** includes Modules 11 to 16. \
  [Certificate]() obtained with a grade of % (*not shown on the certificate but you can find a view [here]()*) \
  [Certifcate Verification]()

## Common Files

There are some file types which will appear in every lab assignment. \
I will just describe their purpose here instead of repeating in each README.md. 

`***.uvproj` `***.uvgui` `***.uvopt` - uVision files (open `***.uvproj` to get the full project) \
`***.axf` `TExaS.h` `texas.o` - autograder files \
`tm4c123gh6pm.h` - useful address definitions for launchpad \
`startup.s` - assembly startup file

## Requirements

**[Kiel uVsion 4](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/armv4.htm)** - All the code/debug were done on this IDE. \
**[Stellaris/Tiva LaunchPad](http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl)** - Everything is meant to work on a EK-TM4C123G launchpad. \
**[Electronic Components](http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/worldwide.html)** - Some labs requires a set of extra electronic parts.
