Lab 16: Connect a CC3100 booster pack to the LaunchPad and communicate with an access point

## Common Files

There are some file types which will appear in every lab assignment. \
I will just describe their purpose here instead of repeating in each README.md. 

`***.uvproj` `***.uvgui` `***.uvopt` - uVision files (open `***.uvproj` to get the full project) \
`***.axf` `TExaS.h` `texas.o` - autograder files \
`tm4c123gh6pm.h` - useful address definitions for launchpad \
`startup.s` - assembly startup file

## Requirements

**[Kiel uVsion 4](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/armv4.htm)** - All the code/debug were done on this IDE. \
**[Stellaris/Tiva LaunchPad](http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl)** - Everything is meant to work on a EK-TM4C123G launchpad. \
**[Electronic Components](http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/worldwide.html)** - Some labs requires a set of extra electronic parts.
